# Enhancing Program Evaluation Research by Leveraging AI for Integrated Analysis of Mixed-Methods Data

The primary objective of this project is to utilize AI and machine learning to improve the analysis of mixed-methods research involving surveys and focus group designs for program evaluation. By leveraging advanced technologies, we seek to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, extract meaningful insights, and enhance the efficiency of analysis processes.

# Project Setup Instructions

To use the code provided in this repository, please follow the steps below:

1. **Open Google Colab:**
   - Access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the Jupyter Notebook files.

2. **Upload Input Files:**
   - Ensure all files in the `input data` folder are uploaded to your own Google Drive.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook files in Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells in the notebook. Note that the code includes some random number generation, so your output may differ from the example output provided in the `output data` folder. This is expected and acceptable.

### Example Output
- The `output file` folder contains example outputs generated by the code. These outputs are provided for reference purposes.

By following these steps, you'll be able to successfully run the code and generate your own outputs based on the input files you provide.

# My Work

1. I reverse-engineered the 2016 Alabama Youth Tobacco Survey to understand its sampling and weighting processes and applied these techniques to the 2024 Alabama student input data.

2. I employed various machine learning models to predict the outcomes of the 2024 Alabama Youth Tobacco Survey, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.808 and an average regression score of 0.71 on the test dataset.

3. I identified a growing tendency for smoking among Black and two-race youths over the years. To investigate further, I analyzed the survey answer data, which revealed specific trends: a growing number of two-race male youths have shown a tendency to start smoking cigarettes and cigars at 9 years old or younger, while a similar trend is seen among Black female youths. Additionally, I observed that a growing proportion of two-race and Black youths are less likely to quit smoking over time.[Code link](https://github.com/koswjjnd/ISSR/blob/main/ISSR_Improve_Accuracy_Mixed_Data_Shao_Jin/2024_data_output_analysis.ipynb)

4. I also designed a qualitative question regarding tobacco usage and generated synthesized responses to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in coding, analyzing, and summarizing large-scale open-ended feedback. To make this process interactive, I developed an [interactive website](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shao11111/qualitative) where users can submit their own answers, and the model predicts the category their response belongs to.[Code link](https://github.com/koswjjnd/ISSR/blob/main/ISSR_Improve_Accuracy_Mixed_Data_Shao_Jin/qualitative_2024.ipynb)
