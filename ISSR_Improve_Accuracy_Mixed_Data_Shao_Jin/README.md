# Enhancing Program Evaluation Research by Leveraging AI for Integrated Analysis of Mixed-Methods Data
![gsoc24](images/coll.png)

The primary objective of this project is to utilize AI and machine learning to improve the analysis of mixed-methods research involving surveys and focus group designs for program evaluation. By leveraging advanced technologies, we seek to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data, extract meaningful insights, and enhance the efficiency of analysis processes.

# Project Setup Instructions

To use the code provided in this repository, please follow the steps below:

1. **Open Google Colab:**
   - Access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the Jupyter Notebook files.

2. **Upload Input Files:**
   - Ensure all files in the `input file` folder are uploaded to your own Google Drive.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook files in Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells in the notebook. Note that the code includes some random number generation, so your output may differ from the example output provided in the `output file` folder. This is expected and acceptable.

### Example Output
- The `output file` folder contains example outputs generated by the code. These outputs are provided for reference purposes.

By following these steps, you'll be able to successfully run the code and generate your own outputs based on the input files you provide.
